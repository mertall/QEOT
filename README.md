# QEOT
Qualitative Evaluation of Text for Cleaner Knowledge Base

Created 2 preprocessing models, that can be used by any UNIX and LINUX system.

Also developed an 'understandbaility' metric. 
 
 Features need to be loaded into a cloud based chatbot model, of any choosing. We were using DrQA from Facebook, but could not get it set up properly due to dependency issues.
 
 The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with NLP practices, using spacy and CoreNLP. I was able to learn application of various functions within these NLP toolkits. Also researched Squad 2.0 dataset to help develop features and took a great deal of time reading about BERT.
