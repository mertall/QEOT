You can adjust these timeout settings to allocate enough time to avoid a user unexpectedly finding that they need to reauthenticate to Horizon Cloud. Horizon ClientHorizon HTML AccessWorkspace ONEHorizon CloudThese settings are associated with the connection between an end user's endpoint device and their assigned VDI desktops, RDS session desktops, and remote applications provided by Horizon Cloud. These settings are separate from the users' logged-in session to the underlying Windows operating system of those desktops and applications. When Horizon Cloud detects the conditions determined by these settings have occurred, it expires the user's authenticated Horizon Client, Horizon HTML Access, or Workspace ONE connection. Horizon CloudHorizon CloudHorizon ClientHorizon HTML AccessWorkspace ONETimeout Timeout Description Description Client Heartbeat Interval Client Heartbeat Interval Controls the interval between Horizon Client heartbeats and the state of the endpoint's connection to Horizon Cloud. These heartbeats report to the Horizon Cloud connection broker the amount of idle time that has passed in the connection to the endpoint. Idle time occurs when no interaction occurs with the end-point device, as opposed to idle time in the Windows operating system session that underlies the user's desktop or remote application usage. In large desktop deployments, setting the activity heartbeats at longer intervals might reduce network traffic and increase performance.

Horizon ClientHorizon CloudHorizon CloudClient Idle User Client Idle User Maximum time that a user can be idle in a connection between the end-point device and Horizon Cloud. When this maximum is reached, the user's authentication expires and all active Horizon Client, Horizon HTML Access, and Workspace ONE connections are closed. The user must reauthenticate to reopen a connection from their end-point device to Horizon Cloud. Note: Set the Client Idle User timeout to be at least double the Client Heartbeat Interval setting to avoid unexpected disconnects from desktops.

The timeout count starts each time the user authenticates to Horizon Cloud. When this timeout occurs, the user can continue to work. If the user performs an action that causes communication to the Horizon Cloud broker, such as changing settings, the system requires the user to reauthenticate and log back in to their client (Horizon Client, Horizon HTML Access, or Workspace ONE). Note: The Client Broker Session timeout must be at least equal to the sum of the Client Heartbeat Interval setting and the Client Idle User timeout.
