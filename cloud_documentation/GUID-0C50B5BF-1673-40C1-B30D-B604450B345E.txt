VMware DocsMyLibrarytimesMyLibraryMyLibraryclose-lineFor a node in Microsoft Azure, you can use the Import Desktop wizard to create the master virtual machine (VM) using an operating system image from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. In the process, the VM is automatically configured with the elements and agent-related software required to conform to the Horizon Cloud environment's requirements. The resulting VM is also joined to your AD domain as part of the automated process. Horizon CloudAbout this taskImportant:If your node is configured to use a proxy, you must create the base master VM using the alternative manual method, and not the automated Import Desktop method. By default, in the Advanced Options section, the wizard sets Yes to install those agent-related custom setup options that are both appropriate according to your other selections in the wizard and which are supported for use in the Horizon Cloud environment. If you want to change the default selections, expand the Advanced Options section in the Import Desktop - Marketplace window and set the toggles according to your needs. Advanced OptionsYesHorizon CloudAdvanced OptionsAs an example, the 3D support in RDSH agent option is selected by default in the Advanced Options section when you have selected a Microsoft Windows Server operating system in the OS drop-down list. However, when you have selected a Microsoft Windows client operating system that 3D support in RDSH agent option is not selected for installation. Because that option is only applicable for RDSH use, and RDSH farms only use server operating systems, the Import Image wizard automatically sets the appropriate 3D support in RDSH setting based on your OS choice. Advanced OptionsOSOSPrerequisitesBefore running the wizard, ensure that the image name you plan to use was not previously used for a master VM in your Horizon Cloud environment. For example, if a master image was converted into an assignable image so that it is listed on the Images page, do not use the same name for a new master image. Due to a known issue in this release, if you enter the same name, the system will fail to create the VM in Microsoft Azure, but no error message or notification is displayed to you in the Administration Console.

Use the toggles in the Advanced Options section to customize the Horizon agent features that will be installed in the master VM. When the option's toggle is set to Yes, the corresponding feature will be installed in the master VM. Note: This release does not support having the URL Redirection option installed when either the Scanner Redirection and Serial Port Redirection options are installed. As a result, if you toggle URL Redirection to Yes, those other two options cannot be set to Yes at the same time. In addition to the option selected in this Import Desktop wizard, two other Horizon agent features are always installed by default: HTML5 Multimedia Redirection - The feature redirects HTML5 multimedia content in a Chrome or Edge browser to the user's local system for performance optimization. Horizon Performance Tracker - Monitors the performance of the display protocol and system resource usage. Option Description Enable Flash MMR Provides the ability to redirect Flash multimedia content that is streamed to the virtual desktop to stream directly to the client computer and decoded on the client system, for performance optimization.

Note: For guidance on using USB redirection securely, see the View Security guide. For example, you can use group policy settings to disable USB redirection for specific users. URL Redirection Not installed by default. Allows Horizon Client to determine which URLs should be handled by the virtual desktop or application instead of being opened by the users' client system, and open those URLs using the virtual desktop or RDS-based application.

When the VM is created in the node, it is listed on the Imported VMs page. Use the refresh icon to see the latest set of VMs on the page. Even though the VM is listed on the page after several minutes, the master VM is not ready to for installing applications or drivers until the Imported VMs page indicates an active agent-related status. It can take as long as 30 minutes for the agent status to reach active state. DomainImportant:When creating an image in Microsoft Azure China cloud, the process can take up to two (2) hours to complete. The process is subject to geographic network issues that can cause slow download speeds as the binaries are downloaded from the cloud control plane. What to do nextThe resulting domain-joined VM has a local administrator account, with the credentials that you provided in the Import Desktop wizard. If your organization has a policy that prevents use of the local administrator account on domain-joined VMs, you must configure the image VM's DaaS Direct Connect Users local group with the non-local domain accounts you want connecting to the VM to customize the image. For details, see Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported Image. Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported ImageCustomize the image's Windows operating system, including configuring things like wallpapers and installing the applications you want the VM to provide to your end users. If you enabled a public IP address for the VM, you can connect to the created VM by using the IP address displayed on the Imported VMs page in an RDP client like Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection.
