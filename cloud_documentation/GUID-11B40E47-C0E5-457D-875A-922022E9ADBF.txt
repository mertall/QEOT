About this taskWhen a node is deployed with the Internet Enabled Desktops option set to Yes (the default), the deployed Unified Access Gateway is configured with a load balancer IP address that has an auto-generated public FQDN in the form vmw-hcs-nodeID-uag.region.cloudapp.azure.com, where nodeID is the node's UUID and region is the Microsoft Azure region where the node is located.

An SSL certificate that is associated with that FQDN and which is signed by a trusted certificate authority. Your DNS server must map those two FQDNs. When the addresses are mapped, your end users can enter your provided FQDN as the server address in the Horizon Client or use with HTML Access to access the desktops served by that node. ourApps.ourOrg.example.com vwm-hcs-nodeID-uag.region.cloudapp.azure.comnodeIDregionUse these steps to locate a node's load balancer FQDN.
