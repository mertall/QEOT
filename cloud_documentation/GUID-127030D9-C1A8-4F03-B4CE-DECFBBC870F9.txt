Having at least one auxiliary domain-bind account prevents the situation of locking out your administrator users from the Administration Console if the primary bind account becomes inaccessible in the Active Directory domain. You can optionally configure additional auxiliary bind accounts for the Active Directory domains that are registered with your nodes. Then if both the primary and first auxiliary bind accounts configured for the domain become inaccessible, the system uses the next auxiliary bind account to connect to the Active Directory domain. PrerequisitesVerify that the Active Directory domain is registered to the node by navigating to Settings > Active Directory and seeing if the domain is listed on that page.
