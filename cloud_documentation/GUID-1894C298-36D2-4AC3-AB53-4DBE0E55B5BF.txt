You launch that wizard from the node's summary page. About this taskWhen the node is configured to provide Internet-enabled desktops, you provided an FQDN and SSL certificate as part of that configuration. The node's Unified Access Gateway instances are configured with that information. Follow these steps when you need to change the FQDN and certificate. Note:During the time the system is changing the node configuration, end users who have connected sessions served by the node will have those active sessions disconnected. No data loss will occur. After the configuration changes are complete, those users can reconnect. PrerequisitesTo complete this workflow, you must have: A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that is unique to this node. You cannot reuse an FQDN that is already configured for your other deployed nodes. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that is unique to this node. You cannot reuse an FQDN that is already configured for your other deployed nodes. A signed SSL server certificate (in PEM format) based on that FQDN. The Unified Access Gateway capabilities require SSL for client connections, as described in the Unified Access Gateway product documentation. The certificate must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The single PEM file must contain the full entire certificate chain with the private key. For example, the single PEM file must contain the SSL server certificate, any necessary intermediate CA certificates, the root CA certificate, and private key. OpenSSL is a tool you can use to create the PEM file. A signed SSL server certificate (in PEM format) based on that FQDN.
