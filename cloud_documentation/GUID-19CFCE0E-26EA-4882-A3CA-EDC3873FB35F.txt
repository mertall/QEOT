From the Capacity page, you can add new locations and deploy additional nodes into Microsoft Azure. The Capacity page is available from the Settings icon. Horizon CloudSettingsThe Capacity page gives you an overview of your deployed nodes, their status, and how they are doing in terms of utilization and capacity. The Capacity page is also an entry point to drill down into the details of a specific node. For each node, its percentages of utilization and capacity are displayed. Utilization (percentage) The utilization percentage that appears for a node reflects the amount of user activity in terms of active in-use sessions compared to the maximum number of sessions possible in that node. The overall utilization percentage is calculated by adding all of the active sessions on all of your nodes, and then dividing that total by the sum of the nodes' maximum number of sessions. Capacity (percentage) The capacity percentage that appears for a node is measured in terms of the desktops in use compared to the maximum number possible on that node. The total capacity percentage is the sum of the number of desktops in use across all of your nodes divided by the total number of desktops possible across all nodes. By using the Type view, you can drill down to see details of a node's usage of the cores in your Microsoft subscription and how close the node's usage of the Microsoft Azure cores and VM families is to reaching the limits of your subscription. You typically use that information to assess when you might need to add more capacity to that subscription. See the Type View section.

This version is sometimes called the node's manifest number or the node's build number. When an updated version of the node software is available for your node, the screen displays a message which contains the manifest number that is available to apply to your node.

In this view, you can access the subscription information and limits for the subscriptions associated with each node. The percentage of your Microsoft Azure subscription's quota that the nodes in that subscription are using is displayed next to the subscription's name.
