About this taskThese steps are for uploading an SSL certificate so that it gets installed on the node-manager VM. Putting an SSL certificate on the node-manager VM supports the scenarios where: Your end users will connect to their desktops and applications by connecting directly to the node, such as using a VPN, and not through the node's load balancer to the Unified Access Gateway instances. Your end users will connect to their desktops and applications by connecting directly to the node, such as using a VPN, and not through the node's load balancer to the Unified Access Gateway instances. Unified Access GatewayYou plan to use VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ and configure that VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ to point to the node-manager VM's address.

VMware Identity ManagerVMware Identity ManagerIf your end-user connections are going to the node's load balancer or when your VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ is configured to point to the node's load balancer, the connections go through the load balancer to the node's Unified Access Gateway instances and use the certificate that you provided for the Unified Access Gateway configuration. VMware Identity ManagerUnified Access GatewayUnified Access GatewayNote:For a node in the Microsoft Azure cloud, if the node was deployed with the Internet access toggle set to Yes (the default), Unified Access Gateway is already deployed for that node. User connections to the desktops and applications in that node go through Unified Access Gateway.

Upload the certificates after confirming that no users are on the system and no running tasks exist, such as importing base images, publishing images, provisioning farms or desktops, assigning desktops, and so on. PrerequisitesThe Administration Console's Upload Certificate action for loading an SSL certificate into the node-manager VM takes the SSL certificate as three separate files: Upload CertificateA CA.crt file for the CA certificate. A CA.crt file for the CA certificate. CA.crtA SSL.crt file for your CA-signed SSL certificate. A SSL.crt file for your CA-signed SSL certificate. SSL.crtA .key file for the RSA private key. A .key file for the RSA private key. The CA certificate and the SSL certificate must be in PEM format, which is a BASE64-encoded DER representation of an X.509 certificate. They both have a .crt extension, and look like this: The private key must not have a password or passphrase associated with it. The .key file looks like this: ProcedureSelect Settings > Capacity.
