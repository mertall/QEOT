About this taskThese steps describe using a browser to launch a desktop provided by the node. Note:If integration with a VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment is configured, end users might have to access their desktops and remote applications using that environment. See Enforce End-User Access Through VMware Identity Managerâ„¢. VMware Identity Managerâ„¢Enforce End-User Access Through VMware Identity Managerâ„¢PrerequisitesFrom your organization's DNS information, obtain the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your organization has associated in its domain name system (DNS) for end user connections to this Horizon Cloud node, such as desktops.mycorp.example.com. Horizon Clouddesktops.mycorp.example.comFor example, when your Horizon Cloud node in Microsoft Azure is configured to use Unified Access Gateway for end user connections, your organization has a DNS CNAME or A record that maps the FQDN that you provided in the deployment wizard to the auto-generated public FQDN of the node's deployed load balancer. See Obtain the FQDN of the Node's Load Balancer to Map in your DNS Server. Horizon CloudUnified Access GatewayObtain the FQDN of the Node's Load Balancer to Map in your DNS ServerVerify that you have the credentials for a user that has a VDI desktop, RDS desktop, or remote application assignment. ProcedurePoint a browser to a URL of the form https://<desktops-FQDN>, where desktops-FQDN is the fully qualified domain name that was added to your DNS for end-user connections. For example, if your company's DNS associated an FQDN of myDesktops.example.com, point the browser to https://myDesktops.example.com. Point a browser to a URL of the form https://<desktops-FQDN>, where desktops-FQDN is the fully qualified domain name that was added to your DNS for end-user connections. https://<desktops-FQDN>desktops-FQDNFor example, if your company's DNS associated an FQDN of myDesktops.example.com, point the browser to https://myDesktops.example.com. myDesktops.example.comhttps://myDesktops.example.comSign in using the credentials for a user that has a desktop assignment.
