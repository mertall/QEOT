This NSG's purpose is to serve as a template that enables you to open additional ports that might be needed for the remote applications or RDS desktops provided by your farms. Horizon CloudIn Microsoft Azure, a network security group (NSG) governs the network traffic to the resources connected to Azure Virtual Networks (VNet). An NSG defines the security rules that allow or deny that network traffic. For more detailed information about how NSGs filter network traffic, see the Microsoft Azure documentation topic Filter network traffic with network security groups. Filter network traffic with network security groupsWhen a Horizon Cloud node is deployed into Microsoft Azure, an NSG named vmw-hcs-nodeUUID-nsg-template is created in the node's same resource group named vmw-hcs-nodeUUID (where nodeUUID is the UUID for that particular node). Horizon Cloudvmw-hcs-nodeUUID-nsg-templatenodeUUIDnodeUUIDnodeUUIDnodeUUIDBy default, the node's template NSG is configured with no outbound security rules and with the following inbound security rules. These default inbound security rules support your end users' access their RDS session desktops and remote applications for Blast and PCOIP and USB redirection. Table 1.

Every farm has its own NSG that is a copy from the template NSG. A farm's NSG is assigned to the NICs of that farm's server virtual machines (VMs). By default, every farm uses the same default security rules as configured in the node's template NSG. You can modify both the template NSG and the per-farm NSGs. For example, if you have an application in a farm that you know needs an additional port opened for that application, you would modify that farm's NSG to allow network traffic on that port. If you are planning to create multiple farms that need the same port opened, a simple way to support that scenario is to edit the template NSG prior to creating those farms. Important:When planning to modify the base template, make a copy before modifying it. The copy can be a backup in case you need to revert back to the original default settings.
