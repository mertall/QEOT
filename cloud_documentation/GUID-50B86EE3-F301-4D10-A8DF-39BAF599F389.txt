For rules regarding URL links clicked in a remote desktop or application, the GPOs must be linked to the OU that contains your virtual desktops and RDS hosts. You can also apply the group policy settings to a GPO that is linked to the OU that contains your Windows client computers, but the preferred method for configuring client-to-agent redirection is to use the vdmutil command-line utility. Because macOS does not support GPOs, you must use vmdutil if you have Mac clients. vdmutilvmdutilPrerequisitesVerify that the URL content redirection feature is included when Horizon Agent is installed in the master image VM, as described in Create a URL Redirection Customization and Assign it to Users.
