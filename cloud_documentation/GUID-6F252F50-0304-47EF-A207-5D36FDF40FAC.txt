VMware Identity Managerâ„¢VMware Identity Managerâ„¢Workspace ONEAbout this taskVMware Identity Managerâ„¢ is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) offering that provides application provisioning, a self-service catalog, conditional access controls, and single sign-on (SSO) for SaaS, web, cloud, and native mobile applications. VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ is available both as an on-premises product and as a service hosted by VMware. VMware Identity Managerâ„¢VMware Identity Managerâ„¢For an overview of this integration from the perspective of the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment, see the Providing Access to Horizon Cloud overview. You configure desktops and remote application assignments for your users and groups in the Horizon Cloud Administration Console as usual. After you complete the steps to integrate your node with your VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment, you sync the node's assignment information to the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ service. Then you can see the desktops and applications in the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ administration console and your end users can access their desktops from Workspace ONE. You can set up a regular sync schedule to sync the assignment information from Horizon Cloud to your VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment.

Obtain a VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment, either by deploying the on-premises version or by subscribing to the cloud-hosted version. VMware Identity Managerâ„¢Deploy VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ according to the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ guidelines for the deployment model you are using. If you are using the cloud-hosted VMware Identity Managerâ„¢, you must install a VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ connector appliance on premises in your Active Directory network. For details, see the description of the deployment scenario in the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ documentation. Important: Follow these upgrade requirements for the connector version depending on your situation: If your node is at software version earlier than 730 (numbers lower than 730) and you want to use the Linux connector version 2018.1.1.1, then first do the integration steps using version 2017.12.1.0 first, and then upgrade that Linux connector to 2018.1.1.1, following the steps in Preparing to Upgrade VMware Identity Manager Connector. Then upgrade the node later, as described in Updating Your Horizon Cloud Node. If your node is at software version earlier than 730, and you want to use the Windows connector version 2018.1.1.1, then first do the integration steps using version 2017.12.1.0, and then upgrade that Windows connector to version 2018.1.1.1, following the steps in Preparing to Upgrade VMware Identity Manager Connector. Then upgrade the node later, as described in Updating Your Horizon Cloud Node. If your node is at software version later than 730, you would best use the Linux connector version 2018.1.1.1 or the Windows connector version 2018.1.1.1.
