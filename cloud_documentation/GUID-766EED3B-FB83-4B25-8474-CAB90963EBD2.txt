VMware DocsMyLibrarytimesMyLibraryMyLibraryclose-lineAfter the master image virtual machine (VM) for a VDI desktop is created, but before converting it into a published image in Horizon Cloud, you customize the guest Windows operating system (OS) to install and configure all of the things you want to have in your end users' VDI desktops. At this time, you install all of the third-party applications you want available in the VDI desktops. Also at this time, you perform any other customizations in the Windows guest operating system, such as installing special drivers required by your organization's needs, applying wallpaper, setting default colors and fonts, configuring taskbar settings, and other such OS-level items. Horizon CloudAbout this taskAfter the Imported VMs page indicates that your master image virtual machine (VM) has its agent-related status as active, you connect to it using your RDP software and install the applications into the underlying Windows operating system. PrerequisitesVerify the Imported VMs page indicates the agent-related status is active for the VM. Obtain the VM's IP address as displayed on the Imported VMs page. Note:When using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client as your RDP software to connect to the master VM, ensure it is the most up-to-date version. For example, the default RDP software in the Windows 7 operating system is not at a high enough version. The version must be version 8 or higher. Verify you have at least one of the following credentials (user name and password) to log in to the VM's guest Windows operating system: The credentials for the local administrator account that was specified in the Import Image wizard when this master image VM was created, as described in Create a Master Virtual Machine Automatically from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. The credentials for the local administrator account that was specified in the Import Image wizard when this master image VM was created, as described in Create a Master Virtual Machine Automatically from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Create a Master Virtual Machine Automatically from the Microsoft Azure MarketplaceThe credentials for a domain account that is configured in the image VM's DaaS Direct Connect Users local group, as described in Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported Image. The credentials for a domain account that is configured in the image VM's DaaS Direct Connect Users local group, as described in Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported Image. Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported ImageImportant:By default, the installed Horizon agent software prevents using accounts other than the local administrator account to make RDP connections to the configured image. If your organization has a policy that prevents use of the local administrator account on domain-joined VMs, you must first configure the image VM's DaaS Direct Connect Users local group with the non-local domain accounts you want connecting to the VM to customize the image. For those steps, see Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported Image. Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported ImageProcedureUse the VM's IP address in your RDP software to connect to the Windows operating system. If the master image VM was created with a public IP address, you can use that IP address in your RDP software If the master image VM has a private IP address, you must RDP into it by one of these two methods: Using another VM in your Microsoft Azure subscription that does have a public IP address and doing an outbound RDP into the master image VM. Use your VPN and RDP into the master image VM over your corporate network Note: To access a VM that is running the agent-related software components, the version of the Remote Desktop Client must be version 8 or later. Otherwise, the connection fails. Using the most up-to-date Remote Desktop Client is recommended. Use the VM's IP address in your RDP software to connect to the Windows operating system.

Log in to the Windows operating system using the user name and password that was specified in Import Image wizard when the master image VM was created. Enter the username as \username. This account is a local administration account. Note: If you configured the DaaS Direct Connect Users group with domain accounts, you can use one of those accounts to log in. In that case, enter the user name as domain\username where domain is the name of the domain.
