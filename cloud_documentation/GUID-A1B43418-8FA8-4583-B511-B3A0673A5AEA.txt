Horizon Agents InstallerHorizon CloudPrerequisitesVerify that the virtual machine (VM) is created and configured as described in Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft Azure and Prepare the Master Server VM for Agent Installation. Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft AzurePrepare the Master Server VM for Agent InstallationProcedureNavigate to where you downloaded the installer and start it. Important: If you want to use the URL redirection option with the desktops or RDS-based remote applications that will be provided by this base VM, you must use the command line to start the installer, adding the VDM_URL_FILTERING_ENABLED=1 parameter to the command. However, if you do install the URL redirection option, do not install the options for either serial port redirection or scanner redirection. This Horizon Cloud release does not support use of the serial port redirection and scanner redirection options. For example, VMware-Horizon-Agents-Installer-x.y.z-build-x64.exe VDM_URL_FILTERING_ENABLED=1 Where x.y.z and build match the numbers in the file name. After a few minutes, the installation wizard displays its Welcome screen. For a VDI desktop image, the Horizon Cloud Endpoint Desktop image is displayed. For a server image, the Horizon Cloud RDSH App image is displayed. Navigate to where you downloaded the installer and start it.

Manually Pair the Configured Virtual Machine with Horizon CloudFor improved security regarding the use of the Horizon Agent, configure your Active Directory server domain policy GPO (Group Policy Object) to disable weak ciphers in SSL and TLS protocols. For information about disabling weak ciphers when communicating using the SSL/TLS protocol, see the appropriate agent-related information in the VMware Horizon 7 documentation set, such as Disable Weak Ciphers in SSL/TLS.
