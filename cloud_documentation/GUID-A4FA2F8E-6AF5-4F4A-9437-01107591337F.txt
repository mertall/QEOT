This user interface provides an integrated view and centralized access to manage virtual desktops and applications for delivery to your end users. The Administration Console works in an industry-standard Web browser. For the list of supported Web browser types and versions, see the Release Notes. Release NotesImportant:The Administration Console reflects what is available at the current service level. However, when you have nodes that are not yet upgraded to the currently released level, the Administration Console does not display those features that depend on the latest node software level. Also, in a particular release, Horizon Cloud might include separately licensed features. The Administration Console reflects the elements related to such features when your license includes use of such features. Horizon CloudBefore you can perform administrative tasks on a Horizon Cloud node, you must: Horizon CloudDeploy your first node. For details on how to deploy your first node, see the Getting Started guide for this service level. Deploy your first node. For details on how to deploy your first node, see the Getting Started guide for this service level. Getting Started guide for this service levelRegistering at least one Active Directory domain. Registering the domain involves doing a domain bind, providing both a primary domain-bind account and an auxiliary domain-bind account, and doing a domain join. By providing an auxiliary domain-bind account when you first register the domain, you prevent locking your administrator users out of the Administration Console if the primary bind account becomes inaccessible. Registering at least one Active Directory domain. Registering the domain involves doing a domain bind, providing both a primary domain-bind account and an auxiliary domain-bind account, and doing a domain join. By providing an auxiliary domain-bind account when you first register the domain, you prevent locking your administrator users out of the Administration Console if the primary bind account becomes inaccessible. Granting the super administrator role to at least one of your Active Directory groups. Important: The domain-join account used when registering the domain must be in one of the Active Directory groups that is granted the super administrator role. If not, system operations that involve joining virtual machines to the domain will fail, such as when importing master images or creating RDSH farms and virtual desktops.

For details, see Register Your Horizon Cloud Node's First Active Directory Domain. Register Your Horizon Cloud Node's First Active Directory DomainAfter completing those steps, a best practice is to follow the recommended actions displayed in the Getting Started wizard. After the first Active Directory domain is registered with the node, you can subsequently register and join additional Active Directory domains to enable assignment of virtual desktops from this Horizon Cloud node to users in those domains, as well as configure additional auxiliary domain bind accounts and an auxiliary domain join account. Horizon Cloud nodeRegister Your Horizon Cloud Node's First Active Directory DomainAfter you have successfully deployed your first node and it is successfully paired with Horizon Cloud, you log in to Horizon Cloud at cloud.horizon.vmware.com to register an Active Directory domain, perform the domain join and bind, and assign the super administrator role to at least one of the groups in that domain.

You use an industry standard browser to log in to the interface. Some details of the login steps vary depending on the configuration of your specific environment. Log in to the Horizon Cloud Administration ConsoleLog in to the Horizon Cloud Administration ConsoleGive Administrative Access to People in Your OrganizationWhen signing in to the Administration Console, the first login screen requires an existing My VMware account that is associated with your Horizon Cloud environment. To give other users in your company or organization ability to log in to that first login screen, you associate the users' My VMware accounts with your environment. You also associate each My VMware account with the Horizon Cloud role that is appropriate for their job role.

Register Additional Active Directory Domains with Your Horizon Cloud NodeRegister Additional Active Directory Domains with Your Horizon Cloud NodeAdd Additional Auxiliary Bind Accounts for an Active Directory Domain Registered to Your Horizon Cloud NodeWhen you register the first Active Directory domain for your node, one auxiliary domain-bind account is required in the configuration. Having at least one auxiliary domain-bind account prevents the situation of locking out your administrator users from the Administration Console if the primary bind account becomes inaccessible in the Active Directory domain. You can optionally configure additional auxiliary bind accounts for the Active Directory domains that are registered with your nodes. Then if both the primary and first auxiliary bind accounts configured for the domain become inaccessible, the system uses the next auxiliary bind account to connect to the Active Directory domain. Add Additional Auxiliary Bind Accounts for an Active Directory Domain Registered to Your Horizon Cloud NodeAdd Additional Auxiliary Bind Accounts for an Active Directory Domain Registered to Your Horizon Cloud NodeAssign Horizon Cloud Administrative Roles to Active Directory GroupsUse the Administration Console's role-based access control to determine which administrative privileges are granted to which of your Active Directory user accounts. When logging in to the Administration Console, the second login screen uses the Active Directory account credentials. The system provides predefined roles that you can assign to your Active Directory groups.
