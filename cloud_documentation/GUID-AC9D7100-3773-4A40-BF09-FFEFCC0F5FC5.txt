Manually building a master virtual machine (VM) that conforms to the Horizon Cloud environment's requirements is a multi-step process. You perform most of these steps in the Microsoft Azure portal. You first create and configure a base VM, then install agent-related software components into that base VM, and then configure specific properties for those agent-related components. Horizon CloudAbout this taskUse these steps only if you do not want to use the automated Import Desktop wizard and instead want to manually build the master VM using the Microsoft Azure portal or if you have already manually built a VM using the Microsoft Azure portal and you want to use that VM for your master VM. The recommended automated way to build a master VM for a node in Microsoft Azure is to use the Import Desktop wizard and its From Microsoft Azure Marketplace option. For details about using the automated wizard, see Create a Master Virtual Machine Automatically from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. From Microsoft Azure MarketplaceCreate a Master Virtual Machine Automatically from the Microsoft Azure MarketplaceImportant:If you have a VM in Microsoft Azure that you want to use as the master's base VM, you must ensure it conforms to the same criteria as when a base VM is created using the manual steps documented in Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft Azure. If the VM does not conform to the same criteria, Horizon Cloud cannot consume it to display in the Administration Console and use in the Convert to Image workflow. The following criteria are critical: Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft AzureHorizon CloudBefore installing the agent-related software, the base VM must have the Storage - Use managed disk setting set to Yes. If the base VM does not adhere to this setting, Horizon Cloud cannot consume this VM. Before installing the agent-related software, the base VM must have the Storage - Use managed disk setting set to Yes.

Storage - Use managed diskYesHorizon CloudThe base VM must be in the same Microsoft Azure location as the node where you want to use that base VM. The base VM must be in the same Microsoft Azure location as the node where you want to use that base VM. The base VM must be put into a specific resource group in your Microsoft Azure subscription. This resource group is one that belongs to the node where you plan to use that base VM. The resource group is named vmw-hcs-nodeID-base-vms, where nodeID is the node's UUID identifier.

The base VM must be connected to the node's subnet named vmw-hcs-nodeID-net-tenant. vmw-hcs-nodeID-net-tenantnodeIDThe base VM must use an operating system currently supported for use in this Horizon Cloud release. Those operating systems are described in the steps in Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft Azure. The base VM must use an operating system currently supported for use in this Horizon Cloud release. Those operating systems are described in the steps in Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft Azure. Horizon CloudCreate the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft AzureDo not configure the base VM to use IPv6 IP addresses. The Administration Console will report an IP abnormal alert in the Desktop Health tab for VMs that are based on a master VM that uses IPv6 IP addresses. Do not configure the base VM to use IPv6 IP addresses. The Administration Console will report an IP abnormal alert in the Desktop Health tab for VMs that are based on a master VM that uses IPv6 IP addresses. To verify your base VM meets that criteria before you start to configure it further, log in to the Horizon Cloud Administration Console, navigate to the Inventory VMs page, and verify your base VM is listed on that page. If it is listed, then that base VM meets the above criteria and you can safely proceed with the remaining configuration steps starting with the topics listed in Prepare the Manually Created Master VM Prior to Installing the Agents. Horizon CloudPrepare the Manually Created Master VM Prior to Installing the AgentsProcedureCreate the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft AzureIn the Microsoft Azure portal, you create a virtual machine (VM) with the Windows guest operating system that you want to use for the VDI desktops, RDS-based session desktops, or RDS-based remote applications. You create this VM using the same subscription that you used for the Horizon Cloud node. Create the Virtual Machine Manually in Your Node in Microsoft AzureHorizon CloudPrepare the Manually Created Master VM Prior to Installing the AgentsWhen manually building a master virtual machine (VM) for your node in Microsoft Azure, you must perform several additional tasks to further prepare the base VM before installing the agent-related software components. You perform these steps using the Microsoft Azure portal and connecting into the new VM.
