Farms simplify the management of the RDS hosts. You can create farms to serve groups of users that vary in size or have different desktop or application requirements. Before you can assign session-based desktops or remote applications to end users, you must create the farms to serve those desktops and applications. A farm can provide either session-based desktops or remote applications. Use the Farms page in the Administration Console to manage your farms.
