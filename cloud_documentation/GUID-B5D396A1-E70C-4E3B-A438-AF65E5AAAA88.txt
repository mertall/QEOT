A typical reason to update an already published image is to install additional third-party applications or other features. About this taskNote:If you are changing the image to update the Horizon Cloud agent-related components, you use a different procedure. See Updating the Agent-Related Software Used by Horizon Cloud and its subtopics. Horizon CloudUpdating the Agent-Related Software Used by Horizon CloudAt a high-level, the workflow to update an in-use image is: Duplicate the existing image to create an image with the same configuration and a new name. In the duplication process, the system clones the sealed image's virtual machine (VM) to make a new unpublished master VM, and lists the new master VM on the Imported VMs page. Duplicate the existing image to create an image with the same configuration and a new name. In the duplication process, the system clones the sealed image's virtual machine (VM) to make a new unpublished master VM, and lists the new master VM on the Imported VMs page. When you see that the Imported VMs page reports the new master VM's agent is active, log in to the VM and make your desired changes to that duplicate VM. When you see that the Imported VMs page reports the new master VM's agent is active, log in to the VM and make your desired changes to that duplicate VM. Use Convert to Image to publish that duplicate VM, making it an assignable (sealed) image. Use Convert to Image to publish that duplicate VM, making it an assignable (sealed) image. Convert to ImageEdit the VDI desktop assignments that are using the original image to use the newly updated duplicate image instead of the original one. Edit the VDI desktop assignments that are using the original image to use the newly updated duplicate image instead of the original one. PrerequisitesVerify you have local administrator account credentials to log in to the image and update it. This administrator account is the same one that was used to publish the image using the New Image workflow. See Convert a Configured Master Virtual Machine to an Assignable Image. Convert a Configured Master Virtual Machine to an Assignable ImageNote:When using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client as your RDP software to connect to the master VM, ensure it is the most up-to-date version. For example, the default RDP software in the Windows 7 operating system is not at a high enough version. The version must be version 8 or higher.

After you enter a new name and click Save, the system clones the sealed image's VM to make a new master VM, and lists the new master VM on the Imported VMs page. Note: As the system begins the cloning process, the original sealed image goes into Transition status for the first part of the process. After some time, the original sealed image returns to its original state. Select the check box for the image and click Duplicate. DuplicateIn the dialog box, enter a name for the duplicate image.

If the original image was created with a public IP address, the new duplicate VM has a public IP address and you can use that IP address in your RDP software If the original image was not created with a public IP address, the new duplicate VM has an IP that is private in your Microsoft Azure cloud environment, and you must RDP into it by one of these two methods: Using another VM in your Microsoft Azure subscription that does have a public IP address and doing an outbound RDP into the VM.

ResultsWhen you update a VDI desktop assignment to change its image: Unassigned, powered-off VMs in the assignment are automatically recreated using the new image. Unassigned, powered-off VMs in the assignment are automatically recreated using the new image. Unassigned VMs that are powered on but do not have an active end user connection are automatically recreated with the new image. Unassigned VMs that are powered on but do not have an active end user connection are automatically recreated with the new image. Unassigned VMs that are powered on and which have an active end user connection, such as those from a floating VDI desktop assignment, are automatically updated with the new image when the end user logs off. Unassigned VMs that are powered on and which have an active end user connection, such as those from a floating VDI desktop assignment, are automatically updated with the new image when the end user logs off. Desktop VMs that are mapped to an end user, such as those from a dedicated VDI desktop assignment, are not automatically updated to the new image. To get such an assigned desktop VM updated to use the new duplicate image instead, you must manually unassign that desktop VM. The next time the system goes to power on the desktop VM, it will apply the new image. Then you can manually assign that desktop VM back to a specific end user.

What to do nextWhen you have updated the VDI desktop assignments that are using the original image and you can determine the original image is no longer needed by your organization, use the Images page to delete the original image. Deleting the original image is a best practice, to prevent other administrators in your organization from using an image that has down-level software.
