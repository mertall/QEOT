A desktop image must display the Published status on the Images page before the system can use it for assignments. About this taskImportant:If your node is configured to use a proxy, you are responsible for providing a way for the farm server VMs or VDI desktop VMs that are created using this image to be configured with the proxy. PrerequisitesVerify that a configured master VM is available in the Horizon Cloud node in which you want to create the assignable image. Horizon CloudVerify that the Imported VMs page indicates that the master VM is powered on (green status) and its agent-related status is active. Verify you have the credentials of an enabled local administrator account in the master image VM. The system uses the local administrator account in the image sealing process, which converts the master image into the published state. Typically, the VM's only enabled local administrator account is the one that you named when you created the master image VM, as described in Creating Desktop Images for a Horizon Cloud Node in Microsoft Azure and its subtopics. Creating Desktop Images for a Horizon Cloud Node in Microsoft AzureImportant:Unless you manually added additional local administrator accounts to the base master VM, the VM's only local administrator account is the one you specified when you ran the Import Desktop wizard, or when you manually created the base master VM.

Node Select the node that has the configured master VM. Desktop This field lists the VMs located on the selected node that the system can convert to an assignable image. Select the one you want. After you make a selection, information about the selected VM is displayed, such as its status. Image Name This field is auto-populated with the image name associated with the Desktop selection. Company Name Type an identifying name. This name will appear in the virtual desktops that get created based on this image. The publishing process sets the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\RegisteredOwner to this value. The name will appear in the About Windows dialog in those virtual desktops as the registered organization and owner. Timezone Retain the default.

Sealed images are those VMs that the system can use in RDSH farms for delivering session-based desktops and remote applications (in the case of RDS-enabled Windows Server operating systems) or use in VDI desktop assignments (in the case of Windows client operating systems. Horizon CloudIf you find you need to change something in a sealed VM's guest Windows operating system, use the steps in the following topics, as appropriate for the situation: To update a sealed image with a Microsoft Windows Server operating system, see Change RDS-Enabled Images Used for Farms To update a sealed image with a Microsoft Windows Server operating system, see Change RDS-Enabled Images Used for Farms Change RDS-Enabled Images Used for FarmsTo update a sealed image with a Microsoft Windows client operating system, see Change Images Used for VDI Desktop Assignments To update a sealed image with a Microsoft Windows client operating system, see Change Images Used for VDI Desktop Assignments Change Images Used for VDI Desktop AssignmentsImages in Published status are not listed on the Imported VMs page. They are removed from the Imported VMs page when they reach Published state. At that point, those sealed VMs are available on the Images page.
