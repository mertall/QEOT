However, you cannot specify a nested OU in that text box. You must locate the nested OU information for your organization, then manually enter it in the Computer OU field.

An OU path that is longer than 64 characters, but with no individual OU having more than 64 characters, is valid. However, each individual OU must be 64 characters or less. As a result, in the Administration Console's Active Directory page's Default OU field and the farm and VDI desktop assignments' Computer OU fields, you can enter OUs that are up to 64-characters long, not counting the OU= portion of your entry.
