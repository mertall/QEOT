You use the Administration Console to configure this information. VMware Identity Managerâ„¢VMware Identity Managerâ„¢About this taskYou use the Administration Console's Identity Management page to configure the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ information for a node. VMware Identity Managerâ„¢PrerequisitesVerify that you have the following information: The SAML identity provider (IdP) metadata URL from your VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment. You obtain the environment's SAML IdP metadata URL using the VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ administration console and navigating to Catalog > Settings > SAML Metadata. When you click the Identity Provider (IdP) metadata link on that page, your browser's address bar displays the URL, typically in the form https://VMwareIdentityManagerFQDN/SAAS/API/1.0/GET/metadata/idp.xml, where VMwareIdentityManagerFQDN is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ environment.

Obtain the FQDN that your organization's DNS records maps to the node's load balancer FQDN or to the node's tenant appliance IP address, whichever one you configured VMware Identity Managerâ„¢ to point to and which you tell your end users to make their connections to connect to Horizon Cloud. This address is typically the FQDN that your organization's DNS records map to the node's load balancer FQDN (if the deployed node has Unified Access Gateway) or to the node's tenant appliance IP address.
