You primarily use the Capacity page to work with your nodes. See Capacity Page. Capacity PageIn addition to the Capacity page, you can use the Dashboard page to get a snapshot view of the health, allocated capacity and utilization, and user activity for your entire set of nodes. See Dashboard Page. Dashboard PageDeploying Additional Horizon Cloud Nodes into Microsoft AzureAfter the first node deployment, you can deploy additional nodes from the Capacity page. Deploying Additional Horizon Cloud Nodes into Microsoft AzureDeploying Additional Horizon Cloud Nodes into Microsoft AzureUpdate the Subscription Information Associated with Deployed NodesIn some circumstances, you might want to update the subscription information that is associated with your deployed nodes. For example, if you created the subscription's application key to have it expire in one year, the year passes, and the key expires, you would have to use the Microsoft Azure portal to create a new key for the subscription. After creating the new key, then you need to update the subscription information in the Administration Console to enter the new key there. Update the Subscription Information Associated with Deployed NodesUpdate the Subscription Information Associated with Deployed NodesExamine a Subscription's Current Usage of Your Microsoft Azure LimitsHorizon Cloud monitors your nodes' usage of your subscription's limits. The Microsoft Azure limits are also known as quotas. The Dashboard page displays health warning information when the usage gets close to reaching the maximum limits on your subscription. You can examine the current usage for a given subscription.

VMware typically updates the in-cloud management environment on a weekly basis and updates the software components used in a deployed node on a roughly quarterly basis. The normal update process takes place without incurring any system downtime.

You launch that wizard from the node's summary page.

The Remove Subscription action is available for an unused subscription on the Type view of the Capacity page.

When you want the node to serve Internet-enabled desktops and remote applications, the node deployment wizard requires a PEM-format file to provide the SSL server certificate chain to the node's Unified Access Gateway configuration. The single PEM file must contain the full entire certificate chain including the private key: the SSL server certificate, any necessary intermediate CA certificates, the root CA certificate, and private key.

In addition, your DNS must resolve specific names as described in this topic. Then, after the node is successfully deployed, specific ports and protocols are required for ongoing Horizon Cloud operations.
