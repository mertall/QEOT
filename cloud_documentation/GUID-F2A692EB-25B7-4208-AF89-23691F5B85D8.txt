Clients connecting directly to the node-manager VM IP address. If your connections always use the node's load balancer which goes to the node's Unified Access Gateway instances, or your VMware Identity Managerâ„¢â„¢ is configured with its connector pointing to that load balancer, uploading the SSL certificate to the node directly is not necessary. In general, uploading an SSL certificate to the node directly is a recommended practice, because that ensures clients that might make direct connections to the node environment can have trusted connections.

In a master image for VDI desktops, install the third-party applications you want your end users to use in their VDI desktops, optimize the image for sysprep best practices, and configure other applicable customizations, such as setting desktop wallpaper, and so on. Customize the Guest Windows Client Operating System of the Master VDI Desktop Virtual Machine. In a master RDS-enabled server image for provisioning RDSH-based session desktops and remote applications, install the third-party applications you want to provide to your end users from that RDS image and configure other applicable customizations, such as setting desktop wallpaper, installing the NVIDIA GPU drivers (for NV-series-based images), and so on. Customize the Guest Windows Server Operating System of the Master Server Image Virtual Machine. Install NVIDIA Graphics Drivers in a GPU-Enabled Master Image. Note: If you created the master image manually instead of using the Import Image wizard and you want to use your User Environment Manager environment with your desktops, you would also install the User Environment Manager agent. The agent is automatically installed when the image is created using the Import Image wizard. See Install the User Environment Manager Agent in the Master Virtual Machine. Important: As part of the configuration process, the master VM is joined to your domain. If your organization has a policy that prevents use of local administrator accounts on domain-joined VMs, you will not be able to log in to the master image to customize it until you configure the DaaS Direct Connect Users local group with those domain accounts you want used for customizing the image.

When a node is deployed with the Internet Enabled Desktops option set to Yes (the default), the deployed Unified Access Gateway is configured with a load balancer IP address that has an auto-generated public FQDN in the form vmw-hcs-nodeID-uag.region.cloudapp.azure.com, where nodeID is the node's UUID and region is the Microsoft Azure region where the node is located. In the deployment wizard, you provided: Your FQDN (for example, ourOrg.example.com or ourApps.ourOrg.example.com). This FQDN is the one which your end users use to access their desktops. An SSL certificate that is associated with that FQDN and which is signed by a trusted certificate authority. Your DNS server must map those two FQDNs. When the addresses are mapped, your end users can enter your provided FQDN as the server address in the Horizon Client or use with HTML Access to access the desktops served by that node. ourApps.ourOrg.example.com vwm-hcs-nodeID-uag.region.cloudapp.azure.comFor details on how to locate the load balancer's public FQDN in the Administration Console, see Obtain the FQDN of the Node's Load Balancer to Map in your DNS Server.
