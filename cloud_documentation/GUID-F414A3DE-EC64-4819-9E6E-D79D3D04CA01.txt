You download the pairing bundle from the Administration Console's Active Directory page. Horizon CloudAbout this taskThe pairing bundle contains a certificate file for each Horizon Cloud node in your environment. For the nodes for which you want to configure True SSO, you upload those nodes' certificate files to the Enrollment Server. When you have one node, the bundle contains one certificate file in CRT format. When you have more than one node, the bundle contains multiple CRT files, one per node. The name of each CRT file follows the pattern: Horizon CloudnodeUUID_truesso.crtnodeUUIDwhere nodeUUID is the node's UUID that is displayed in the node's summary page. nodeUUIDProcedureIn the Administration Console, navigate to Settings > Active Directory.
