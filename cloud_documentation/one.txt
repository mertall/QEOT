Open a command prompt as administrator and navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\Horizon Agents\Horizon DaaS Agent\service. Run Keytool.exe using the downloaded DaaS SSL bootstrap file (image_bootstrap.7z) as an argument. Keytool.exe â€“f absolute-path-to-bootstrap-file/image_bootstrap.7z When prompted, enter the encryption password that you set when you downloaded the DaaS SSL bootstrap file. Note: Ensure that step 2 to add the registry key is completed before you run the Keytool utility. If the registry key does not exist, the Keytool command might fail with the message Cannot find the file specified. The Keytool utility performs the bootstrap and moves the certificate to the cert folder. If you see a message that the file is successfully decrypted, this step is complete.

To confirm that this VM can be converted into a sealed image, in the Horizon Cloud Administration Console, navigate to Inventory > Imported VMs and check that an ACTIVE status is displayed in the Agent Version column for this VM. Horizon CloudHorizon CloudInventory > Imported VMsInventoryImported VMsACTIVEAgent VersionIf your organization has a policy that prevents use of the local administrator account on domain-joined VMs, you must use GPO to configure the image VM's DaaS Direct Connect Users local group with the non-local domain accounts you want connecting to the VM to customize the image. For details, see Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported Image. Configure the Ability for Domain Accounts to Remote Connect to the Imported ImageCustomize the image's Windows operating system, including configuring things like wallpapers and installing the applications you want this VM to provide to your end users. If you enabled a public IP address for the VM, you can connect to the created VM by using the IP address displayed on the Imported VMs page in an RDP client like Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. For details, see Customize the Guest Windows Client Operating System of the Master VDI Desktop Virtual Machine. Customize the Guest Windows Client Operating System of the Master VDI Desktop Virtual MachineIf you selected a NV-series VM type, you must log into the VM's operating system and install the supported NVIDIA graphics drivers to get the GPU capabilities of the GPU-enabled NV-series VM. You install the drivers after the VM is created and the Imported VMs page shows the DaaS agent is active. See Install NVIDIA Graphics Drivers in a GPU-Enabled Master Image. Install NVIDIA Graphics Drivers in a GPU-Enabled Master ImageIf you want to use User Environment Manager with this VM, you must log into the VM's server operating system and manually install the User Environment Manager agent, which is named FlexEngine.
